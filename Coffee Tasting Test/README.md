# James Hoffmann's Great American Coffee Tasting Test

## Description

In 2023, [James Hoffmann](https://www.youtube.com/@jameshoffmann), one of the world's leading coffee experts, partnered with Cometeer for a relatively large coffee tasting test in the US. This data was gathered, aggregated and anonymized, with [Hoffmann releasing a video with some analysis of the data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMOOQfeloH0), as well as making the data publicly available.

This project aims to aggregate and present the data shown in James' video in a concise and interactive way using Microsoft Power BI, and present some new insights.
